- Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
- Frontend: React.js, Apollo Client
- Database: PostgreSQL (or any other preferred database supported by Django)
- Authentication: Django Authentication System (or Django REST Framework JWT for token-based authentication)
- GraphQL: Apollo Server (integrated with Django using **`graphene-django`**)

This project provides a good mix of backend and frontend development, integrating Django with Apollo GraphQL for efficient data communication. It also covers essential features like user authentication, CRUD operations, and real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions.
